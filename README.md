# ErgoBox
ErgoBox on android

The purpose of this project is to build an android application to replace the hardware of an ergo box.

See  [Eurocontrol old ERGO doc](https://www.eurocontrol.int/ergo-version-2-instantaneous-self-assessment-workload-real-time-environment).

The tutorial [android socketio](https://dev.to/medaymentn/creating-a-realtime-chat-app-with-android--nodejs-and-socketio-4o55)
will be used as inspiration for the architecture.

A running simulation is quite similar to the concept of room in socketio.
